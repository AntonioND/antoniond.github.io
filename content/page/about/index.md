title: "About me"

I'm **Antonio Niño Díaz**, and this is a short story of my hacking life.

I'm Spanish, born in a city near Madrid. I studied Industrial Engineering in
Madrid, and specialized in Electronics and Control. After getting my degree I
got a job at Arm in Cambridge, UK, where I've lived since January 2016.

Most of what I know about programming is self-taught. I started trying a few
simple things in BASIC on my father's Amstrad CPC. I eventually came across Game
Maker and started to program for PC an to understand how games are made, what
objects are, that kind of things.

At some point, when I was 15, I discovered that I could also write my own
programs for the Nintendo DS. That's when I started to learn **C**. Then I
realized everything that it could do, and the fact that it can be used to
develop for pretty much any device you can think of. It has been my favourite
programming language ever since.

I also discovered microcontrollers thanks to the Wii hacking scene, and starting
to program a bit in assembly. I find it amazing that I can control things in the
real world by just programming a small chip. I've played quite a bit with PIC
microcontrollers.

I eventually moved to PC and wrote GiiBiiAdvance, my GBC and GBA emulator. And
then, as I knew the instruction set of the GBC, I decided to start developing
things in assembly for the GBC.

Something else I love are FPGAs. I learned about them at university, and I had
to buy one to play with at home. I don't use it nearly as much as I'd like,
though, but it's one of the things I'm most interested in at the moment.

And this is the end, for now. Just take a look at my projects in this website,
and know that I'm always available to answer questions about them!
