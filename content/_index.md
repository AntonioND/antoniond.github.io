title: 'SkyLyrac'

Welcome to my website!

I'm Antonio, a Spanish developer that likes to work on FOSS projects in retro
Nintendo consoles.

This is my [blog](./blog). It's pretty minimalistic, and it has some very old
posts (I started it in 2009!).

You can see my projects in [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/SkyLyrac). Currently
I spend most of my free time working on an SDK for the Nintendo DS called
[BlocksDS](https://blocksds.skylyrac.net/), also hosted in
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/blocksds).

I'm usually available to chat in the [GBADev](https://gbadev.net) Discord
server (my username is skylyrac).
