Hello again!

This is just a bugfix release. I've modified the samples included in the mod
file in order to avoid transposing notes when converting it with mod2gbt. This
means that you can use all notes from C3 to B8.

You can find source, binaries and examples (RGBDS and GBDK) for version 1.2
here:

And any other improvements, here:

Bye!
