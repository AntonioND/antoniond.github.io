Hello!

This is a program I've been coding for university. It is a library for the
HP50g. This program draws the root locus of a given transfer function and lets
you add a regulator, as well as change the proportional value of the regulator
and see the new position for the poles of the system for that value.

I've sent it to [www.hpcalc.org](http://www.hpcalc.org), too. There are a lot of
great programs there. Anyway, the download link is here:

[Download (Binary + Source)](/downloads/rlocus_0_2.zip)

There are instructions on how to install and use it, they should be clear enough
for anybody. The source code is included (HP-GCC 2.0 and HP files for packaging
the library).
