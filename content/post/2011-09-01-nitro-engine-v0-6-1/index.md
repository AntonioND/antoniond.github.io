Well... I just looked at the code this morning and saw that the code looked
horrible... So I just reorganised it a bit (included the code of examples),
added a few "static" keywords and fixed a few warnings related to new versions
of libnds and devkitARM. Nothing else, though. Everything worked fine, so I
didn't have to do anything else...
