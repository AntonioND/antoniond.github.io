Ok, this has nothing to do with [this other game](/old-site/pong3ds.html).

This is just a stupid stereoscopic 3D software rendering test. Oh, the 3D slider
actually does something when you change its position.

No screenshot because it's just a bunch of wireframe boxes IN THREE DIMENSIONS.
Maybe next time.
