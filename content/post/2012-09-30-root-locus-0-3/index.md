Well, I should have put this here a few months ago, but I've been lazy to do so.

Anyway, here is Root Locus 0.3. It now supports discrete systems, and it lets
you set a value for 'k' (the one of the regulator) manually. You can also ask it
for the position of the poles in the current position. Everything is in the
manual.
