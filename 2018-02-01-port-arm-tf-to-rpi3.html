                <p>This is a small project I worked on before Christmas. The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware">Trusted Firmware-A</a> is a reference
implementation of a secure firmware for ARMv8-A CPUs. It has ports to both
AArch64 (64-bit Arm Instruction Set Architecture) and AArch32 (32-bit Arm ISA).
AArch32 is almost the same as ARMv7-A, for backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>The SoC of the Raspberry Pi 3 is the Broadcom BCM2937, which has 4 Cortex-A53
cores. The Cortex-A53 is a microarchitecture that implements the ARMv8-A ISA
with both 64 and 32-bit modes, so it is possible to port the Trusted Firmware-A.
At work I'm one of the engineers working on the Trusted Firmware-A, and I really
like the Raspberry Pi, so I simply couldn't resist, I needed to have the Trusted
Firmware running on it.</p>
<p>Even though the Trusted Firmware has ports to both AArch64 and AArch32, the one
that interests me is AArch64. There is no real advantage for making the port for
Raspberry Pi run in AArch32 mode. The firmware runs in EL3, the highest
privilege execution level. The architecture allows to downgrade from 64 to
32-bit when reducing the privilege level, but not to increase it. That means
that, for example, if the firmware is running in 64-bit mode, it is possible to
have a 64 or a 32-bit hypervisor in EL2. Similarly, an operating system in
64-bit mode in EL1 can execute both 64 and 32-bit user applications in EL0. In
short, a 64-bit firmware allows any other privilege level to use 64 or 32-bit
mode, but a 32-bit firmware would restrict them to execute in 32-bit mode.</p>
<p>Also, it is important that this port works with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Raspbian</a>. It is the Linux
distribution for the Raspberry Pi with the best support, as it has the support
of the Raspberry Pi Foundation itself. If a port of the Trusted Firmware is to
be done, it's a good idea to make it work with Raspbian.</p>
<p>This port is based on the work of Ard Biesheuvel (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ardbiesheuvel">&#64;ardbiesheuvel</a>), explained <a class="reference external" href="http://www.workofard.com/2017/02/uefi-on-the-pi/">in this article</a>. The port is in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ardbiesheuvel/arm-trusted-firmware/tree/rpi3">this
repository</a>.
The port has been heavily modified. For starters, that port didn't manage to
boot Linux or to release the secondary CPUs from their wait loop (the RAM used
as a mailbox wasn't initialized to 0 before entering the wait loop).</p>
<p><strong>Important note</strong>: Even though the Trusted Firmware-A is a reference of a
secure boot flow, the Raspberry Pi 3 doesn't isn't a secure platform. The memory
available to the CPUs is the DRAM, which can be accessed when the CPU is in
Non-secure and Secure modes. However, in order to emulate the normal bootflow,
the memory map is divided in a few regions.</p>
<p>In short, this is a port that can be used to play around with, implement
standard services that the OS can use, etc. This is not meant to be used to
implement secure services in any way.</p>
<p>It could be possible to emulate secure RAM by using the hypervisor translation
tables to hide some memory from the OS, which would act as SRAM. This is
non-trivial, and it is outside of the scope of this project.</p>
<div class="section" id="getting-the-trusted-firmware-a-to-boot">
<h2>Getting the Trusted Firmware-A to boot</h2>
<p>First of all, I connected a UART to USB cable to the Mini UART located in the
pin header. I verified that the connection was working by using <tt class="docutils literal">screen</tt> to
connect to Linux through it. To enable this connection, the file <tt class="docutils literal">config.txt</tt>
on the root of the SD card must contain a line that says <code>enable_uart=1</code>.
Also, I added <code>console=serial0,115200 console=tty1</code> to the file
<tt class="docutils literal">cmdline.txt</tt>. Once I verified that it was working, I started to take a look
at the code of the port.</p>
<p>The port was quite old by the time I started to work on this project, so the
first thing that I did was to rebase the branch, replace some old APIs and
libraries by the new ones, and made sure that it compiled. I also enabled some
CPU errata workarounds that can affect the Cortex-A53. Then, I had to figure out
how to make it run. I needed to get all CPU cores running the same binary at EL3
in AArch64 mode.</p>
<p>The booting process of the Raspberry Pi is quite unusual. The SoC has a
VideoCore IV located between all the Arm cores and the DRAM. It has its own MMU
and tricks the Arm cores into thinking that the physical memory map is different
than it actually is! This VideCore is also the one that has a ROM bootloader
that loads the rest of the files from the SD card. The file <tt class="docutils literal">config.txt</tt> tells
it how to load them, but most of the options of interest to this project are
undocumented. After some googling I managed to find the ones I needed and got
all 4 cores booting in AArch64 mode in EL3. For more details about it, check the
documentation of the port in the official repository of the Trusted Firmware:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/blob/master/docs/plat/rpi3.rst">https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/blob/master/docs/plat/rpi3.rst</a></p>
<p>In short, the kernel has to be renamed to <tt class="docutils literal">kernel8.img</tt> and the firmware has
to be packaged as one single binary and named <tt class="docutils literal">armstub8.bin</tt>. Then, in the
<tt class="docutils literal">config.txt</tt> file I added the following lines to tell the loader where to load
the files in DRAM.</p>
<pre class="code shell literal-block">
<span class="nv">enable_uart</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="nv">kernel_address</span><span class="o">=</span>0x01000000<span class="w">
</span><span class="nv">device_tree_address</span><span class="o">=</span>0x02000000
</pre>
<p>One good thing about this unusual bootflow is that it is literally impossible to
brick the Raspberry Pi, you just need to write the correct files to your SD card
and it will boot again. Also, it gives the user a lot of flexibility on how to
boot the Arm cores. Normally it's not that simple to select AArch64 or AArch32
at the highest Execution Level, that's fixed by the platform. In the Raspberry
Pi, that can be changed by changing a value in the configuration file.</p>
<p>This <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swarren/rpi-3-aarch64-demo">demo by Stephen Warren</a>
was useful to test that my code was running in the conditions I needed. That
demo shows the same message per each CPU with the values of some registers, like
<tt class="docutils literal">CurrentEL</tt>, that shows the EL in which the code is running.</p>
<p>Once this was ready, I just needed to replace that demo by my binary of the
firmware and check if the port was working. I decided to use the binary of the
demo BL33 image, the final payload to be loaded by the firmware, where it jumps
after initializing everything. I got the following output:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
VERBOSE: Reserved 0x12000 bytes (discarded 0x7000 bytes above)
VERBOSE: Trusted SRAM seen by this BL image: 181000 - 0x200000

ERROR:   mmap_add_region_check() failed. error -22
ASSERT:  lib/xlat_tables_v2/xlat_tables_internal.c:753:0
</pre>
<p>Success! Sort of, anyway. That error is <tt class="docutils literal">EINVAL</tt>. It means that there is some
sort of overlap of memory regions, or that the platform is trying to map regions
with invalid values for some reason. I initially thought that it was just that
there wasn't enough memory reserved to setup the translation tables. Anyway,
easy enough to fix! I eventually got this output:</p>

<h2>Getting Linux to boot</h2>
<p>The next step was to actually get the Linux kernel booting. The Linux kernel
image simply replaces the demo I was using as BL33 image.</p>
<p>I didn't have a 64-bit kernel to test with, though, just a 32-bit one (the one
that comes with Raspbian). According to the Linux boot documentation for the Arm
32-bit kernel (located in <tt class="docutils literal">Documentation/arm/Booting</tt> in the Linux kernel
tree), it likes to start in Hypervisor mode. I just needed to tweak the final
step of the firmware (the jump to the BL33 entrypoint) so that it jumped to this
mode instead of EL2 in AArch64 mode.</p>
<p>This is easy, it is only needed to modify the value of <tt class="docutils literal">SPSR</tt> at the time it
jumps to BL33. With the correct value, it jumps to the entrypoint in AArch32 in
hypervisor mode. I didn't want to close the door to a 64-bit kernel, so I just
created a build option, <tt class="docutils literal">RPI3_BL33_IN_AARCH32</tt>, that would let the developer
choose EL2 in AArch64 or Hypervisor in AArch32.</p>

<p>The secondary cores couldn't come online because this kernel doesn't know about
PSCI, which is the standard way of powering on Arm cores. But that's not a
problem, there is a workaround, the kernel also has support for booting
secondary cores by making them wait in a wait loop.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-the-secondary-cores-to-work">
<h2>Getting the secondary cores to work</h2>
<p>The port I used as a base already had an implementation of the SMC (System
Monitor Call) <tt class="docutils literal">PSCI_CPU_ON</tt> that made the secondary cores wait in a loop until
it was called, at which point it released them and jumped to the given address.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this can't work with the kernel if it doesn't know about PSCI,
and that was trickier that I expected. In the end, I decided to simply add some
glue code by creating a small bootstrap that would be used as BL33 image and run
in EL2. It would act like a really simple UEFI or U-Boot. The idea is to use
this bootstrap to release the locks from the firmware by calling <tt class="docutils literal">PSCI_CPU_ON</tt>
and make them wait in a wait loop that uses the mailbox that Raspbian knows how
to use to boot the secondary cores. I didn't really know how to do this, so I
just checked how it is done in the official distribution of Raspbian. The
following 2 links contain the bootstraps for a 32-bit kernel and a 64-bit kernel
respectively:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/blob/master/armstubs/armstub7.S">https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/blob/master/armstubs/armstub7.S</a></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/blob/master/armstubs/armstub8.S">https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/blob/master/armstubs/armstub8.S</a></p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">armstub7.S</tt> is used by the Raspberry Pi 2, which has 4 Cortex-A7, but also by
the Raspberry Pi 3 when booting a 32-bit kernel, and it has 4 Cortex-A53.
<tt class="docutils literal">armstub8.S</tt> is used by the Raspberry Pi 3 when booting a 64-bit kernel. The
compiled bootstraps are embedded on one of the elf files that are loaded by the
VideoCore at boot.</p>
<p>After some reverse engineering I created my own versions of the bootstraps:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/AntonioND/rpi3-arm-tf-bootstrap">https://github.com/AntonioND/rpi3-arm-tf-bootstrap</a></p>
<p>As a side effect of my reverse engineering efforts, I checked the Technical
Reference Manuals of the Cortex-A53 and Cortex-A7 and found some really small
bugs in the official bootstrap for the 32-bit kernel. I created a pull request
to fix them:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/pull/85">https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/pull/85</a></p>
<p>However... After all that effort, the secondary cores still refused to work. I
decided to resort to printf-powered debugging and found out that the cores were
actually crashing before the kernel had had the chance to claim them. It took me
some time to understand the reason. Again, <tt class="docutils literal">Documentation/arm/Booting</tt> had the
answer: The kernel copies itself to a different memory region at boot:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
The zImage may also be placed in system RAM and called there.  The
kernel should be placed in the first 128MiB of RAM.  It is recommended
that it is loaded above 32MiB in order to avoid the need to relocate
prior to decompression, which will make the boot process slightly
faster.
</pre>
<p>During this copy, the code of my waitloop was being overwritten. I checked that
moving the firmware to a location far away fixed the problem, but now I really
needed to find a way to protect he memory region used by the firmware. The whole
point of BL31 is to have some services that can be used by the operating system.
If Linux is free to use the memory used by the firmware, this can't work.</p>
<p>I eventually found out the solution: To add <code>memmap=256M$16M</code> to the file
<tt class="docutils literal">cmdline.txt</tt>. This option tells the kernel that at the address 256 MiB there
are 16 MiB that it shouldn't use, even if that range of memory contains valid
ram specified in the device tree that tells it about all the hardware in the
system.</p>

<p>And a photo I took to commemorate the moment. :)</p>

<p>At last, everything was working! Linux could detect all 4 cores! All I needed to
do now is to make sure that my port would also work with a 64-bit kernel, but...
well, I didn't have any 64-bit kernel and I didn't know where to get one from. I
ended up compiling my own.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-a-64-bit-kernel-to-work">
<h2>Getting a 64-bit kernel to work</h2>
<p>It is really simple, actually, you just have to clone the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux">Linux tree fork</a> maintained by the Raspberry Pi
Foundation and compile it for 64-bit:</p>
<pre class="code shell literal-block">
git<span class="w"> </span>clone<span class="w"> </span>--depth<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="w"> </span>-b<span class="w"> </span>rpi-4.14.y<span class="w"> </span>https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux<span class="w">
</span><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>linux<span class="w">
</span>make<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">ARCH</span><span class="o">=</span>arm64<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">CROSS_COMPILE</span><span class="o">=</span>aarch64-linux-gnu-<span class="w"> </span>bcmrpi3_defconfig<span class="w">
</span>make<span class="w"> </span>-j<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">6</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">ARCH</span><span class="o">=</span>arm64<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">CROSS_COMPILE</span><span class="o">=</span>aarch64-linux-gnu-
</pre>
<p>Then, copy the kernel image and the device tree to the SD card.</p>
<pre class="code shell literal-block">
cp<span class="w"> </span>arch/arm64/boot/Image<span class="w"> </span>/path/to/boot/kernel8.img<span class="w">
</span>cp<span class="w"> </span>arch/arm64/boot/dts/broadcom/bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb<span class="w"> </span>/path/to/boot/
</pre>
<p>Finally, install the kernel modules.</p>
<pre class="code shell literal-block">
make<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">ARCH</span><span class="o">=</span>arm64<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">CROSS_COMPILE</span><span class="o">=</span>aarch64-linux-gnu-<span class="w"> </span><span class="se">\
</span><span class="nv">INSTALL_MOD_PATH</span><span class="o">=</span>/path/to/filesystem<span class="w"> </span>modules_install
</pre>
<p>I also had to create a bootstrap in a similar way as I did for the 32-bit
kernel. It was easier now, though. All the booting information is in the file
<tt class="docutils literal">Documentation/arm64/booting.txt</tt>, like with the 32-bit kernel.</p>
<p>After a bit of work, I finally got the kernel booting and releasing all
secondary cores from their loops! The console output for this kernel, however,
is really verbose, so I've cut significant parts of it:</p>

<p>The final thing to do was to write the documentation of this port and to create
a pull request:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/pull/1157">https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/pull/1157</a></p>
<p>It was reviewed and merged, and now the Trusted Firmware-A has an upstream port
for the Raspberry Pi 3! It was a pretty interesting project, I learned a lot
about the Linux kernel boot process and about the kind of problems that people
that do the bringup of a platform have to face.</p>
<p>I hope you found this article interesting!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>As of 2018-03-23, the name of the project is <strong>Trusted Firmware-A</strong>. All
references to <strong>Arm Trusted Firmware</strong> have been replaced by the new name.</p>
